BLOCK-COMMENT IS
Fibonacci Sequence

Equivalent Java code:

int n = 12
int x1 = 0
int x2 = 1

for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  System.out.println("x1")
  int sum = x1 + x2
  x1 = x2
  x2 = sum
}

AND END BLOCK-COMMENT

COMMENT To set your own # of terms, replace 12 below with any number
n IS 12
x1 IS 0
x2 IS 1

FOR (INITIALIZATION IS i IS 1 AND TERMINATION IS i IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO n AND INCREMENT IS i IS ADDED) THEN
  SAY x1
  sum IS x1 PLUS x2
  x1 IS x2
  x2 IS sum
AND END FOR
