Block-Comment is
BABA IS PROGRAM

An esotric language inspired by the game 'Baba is You'

This is a block comment, and you can write it as 'Block-Comment is'.
You can end it like so:

and end Block-Comment

Comment You can also make single-lined comments like this.

Comment In order to declare a variable, you can do <Variable> is <Definition>

StringVar is "String"
IntegerVar is 123

Comment You can do math like so:

IntegerVar2 is 1 plus 2
IntegerVar3 is IntegerVar minus 20

Comment And you can print like so:

Say "Hello, World!"
Say IntegerVar3

Comment And also input:

StringVar is Input
SAY StringVar

Comment This alone should make it Turing Complete (I think, don't quote me on that though.)
Comment Here's some extra stuff that's probably important
Comment Multi-line statements are done like so:

foo is "bar" and hello is "world"

Comment If/else statements are done like so:

If foo is "bar" then
  Say foo
and end If
Else If hello is "world" then
  Say hello
and end If and Comment Either if or else works here.
Else then
  Say "No vars equal to themselves"
end Else

Comment You can also use parenthesis and standard and/or boolean checks.

If (foo is "bar" and hello is "world") or 1 plus 2 is 3 then
  Say "Nice"
and end If

Comment Also Greater/Less than checks are done like this:

If 1 is less than 2 and 2 is greater than or equal to 2 then
  Say "Stuff"
and end If

Comment You can do var++ or var-- like so:

var is 10
var is added
var is subtracted

Comment For statements work similarily to Java/Javascript syntax

For (Initialization is i is 1 and Termination is i is less than 11 and Increment is i is added) then
  Say "i is " plus i
and end For

The Java equivalent would be this:

for (int i = 1; i<11; i++) {
  System.out.println("i is " + i);
}

..anddd that's about it!

There would be stuff like functions and whatnot but in all honesty I'm really bad at programming.
So functions may come sooner or later.

Hopefully.

Oh, and one other thing:

you can simply end the program by saying 'end'
and end Block-Comment

Comment it's not necessary at the end (obviously)
Comment Also, you don't have to capitalize "If", "Else", etc.
Comment I just did that for readability purposes.
Comment They're case-insensitive, so you can go all caps like the original game:

YOU IS "YOU"
BABA IS YOU

IF BABA IS YOU THEN
  SAY BABA
AND END IF

end

SAY "This will not be displayed"
